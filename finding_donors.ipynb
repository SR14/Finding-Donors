    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Random Forest\n",
    "  - Real World Application\n",
    "      - When deciding what product to recommend to a client, we can take into account the products that given client has bought in the past. Breaking down those products into product features, we can apply a random forest on the features and look for a trend taking into account all the potential future products. Future products that share similar features as the ones previously bought will be recommended by the algorithm.\n",
    "  - Strengths\n",
    "      - Fast even w/ high number of features\n",
    "      - Accurate even w/ low amount of observations/data\n",
    "      - Allow for feature importance analysis\n",
    "      - Allows for both classification/regression\n",
    "      - Handles missing values\n",
    "  - Weaknesses\n",
    "      - Due to its ability to interpret high dimensional data, it is also rather difficult to visualize all features. \n",
    "  - What makes this a good candidate for this problem\n",
    "      - There is a very high number of predictive features that come into play when determining what clients make above 50k. Handling a lot of variables is one of random forest's strengths. Also its ability to determine what variables matter most when finding donors will help us further engineer features based on their relevance to the problem. \n",
    "- #### K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "  - Real World Application\n",
    "      - In order to recognize faces, knn can be used to compare face features to a watchlist database. KNN allows for a fast comparison of faces. KNN is used in this way by Herta Security.\n",
    "  - Strengths\n",
    "      - Easy to understand due to simple distance formulas used to calculate classifications.\n",
    "      - Fast adjusting to additional information. \n",
    "  - Weaknesses\n",
    "      - Closely clustered anomalies can cause a problem to the prediction of future predicitons.\n",
    "      - Long computation time due to many calculations being done in both training and testing phase. \n",
    "      - Too many features can cause a lack of effectiveness of the knn due to too many neighbors to choose from. \n",
    "  - What makes this a good candidate for this problem\n",
    "      - KNN is a good candidate for this problem due to the low number of features before dummifying of the data. The knn algorithm will try to group common characteristics of donors together, e.g. age of donor will be a factor when grouping the potential donors if there happens to be a trend between income and age. \n",
    "- #### Support Vector Machines\n",
    "  - Real World Application\n",
    "      - Support vector machines are really good at image classification. It breaks down each feature of an image into a binary output, e.g. does an image contain water, yes or no? Is it night or day? Therefore, combining all of those yes or no answers leads to the conclusion of whether the collected image features match the characteristics of an image you are modeling after.  \n",
    "  - Strengths\n",
    "      - Efficient training due to using boundary data that matters most for differentiating classifications.\n",
    "      - Very accurate when given small datasets to separated by lines and planes. \n",
    "  - Weaknesses\n",
    "      - Not very good with large data sets due to longer fitting time.\n",
    "      - When the data does not contain any constant patterns, it is hard for algorithm to separate predictions. \n",
    "  - What makes this a good candidate for this problem\n",
    "      - If there is a pattern in the data set that tells us who makes the most money, the support vectors will be accurate when separating the people that do make above 50k from the ones that don't.\n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",

    "**Answer:** Based on accuracy, f_score and pred/train time on 100% of the data, I believe the Random Forest Classifier to be the best suited for handling the prediction of donors. Pertaining to its accuracy on never seen data, it achieved the highest score of about 0.839. The SVC beat the RF classifier by 0.002 f_score on the test data. However, the reason why the random forest leaves the SVC in the dust is due to the prediction/training time. While the SVC took a combined 125 seconds to predict and train on the data, the RF classifier took less than .75 of a second. This shows that as the data available grows, so will the fitting and prediction time of the SVC. Therefore, since the Random Forest Classifier has the highest accuracy, and second to highest by 0.002 f_score, but trains and predicts at a very fast speed, I will choose it to move on to the hyperparameter tuning of the model.

    "**Answer:** The best way to understand a Random Forest Classifier is to break it down to its building trees and describe what a decision tree is. A decision tree classifies a label using a yes or no type of system; for example, a decision tree trying to decide whether the specified fruit is a banana or not may ask, Is the color is yellow? If the answer is yes, then the fruit will be labeled as a banana. However, a banana does not only have color as its characteristic. That is where the Random Forest Classifier comes into play. A random forest classifier will take into account more than just one feature, i.e. the color, and ask well what is the shape? Is it a circle? No ok then it might be a banana. Do you have to peel it? Yes, ok then it is probably a banana. Well when a random forest classifier is applied to our problem, it will ask various things about a potential donor and then classify it as a person making more than 50K or less than 50K based on the answers it receives. A Random Forest is then created by taking many random samples of the data and asking the data the same questions to all the samples and checking the training data to see what charactersitics people making over 50K share. Then, taking the average of all the observed samples, it will predict the class of a new person it has not seen before based on what it has asked and learned from the training data; it will predict whether the new person makes over or under 50K.

    "**Answer:** Three out of the five features I predicted to be among the top five most important were actually in the top five. I predicted age to be number 4, but it was number 1. This is surprising as I believed age would play a factor in a person's ability to make 50K a year, but I did not think it would be the most important factor. I predicted hours per week to be second most important and it got third most important; however, looking at the graph hours per week was not too far from becoming the second most important one. I predicted education number to be number 3, but it was 5th most important feature. Country and occupation did not fall under the most important, but I think this is largely due to the fact that the importance of those features, given their categorical nature, got spread out once we dummified the categorical columns into separate features. `'marital-status_Married-civ-spouse'` being the second most important feature really surprised me; based on my past projects, marital status usually does have an impact on the class of a person, but not as much as to become the second most important feature. Capital-gain makes sense to come in 4th since it directly relates to how much a person has gained financially from a purchase/sale."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
